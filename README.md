# pshell-github-backup
This project provides a PowerShell script to back up all repositories from a GitHub organization to a local directory. In case of a disaster or data loss on GitHub, this script ensures that a full, recent copy of all repositories is available locally. Additionally, it sends an email notification if any failures occur during the cloning process.
